# Unit 1: The Building Blocks (Bio Basics)

### Why Engineers Need Biology?
Basically, the 21st century is the "Century of Biology."
* **The Gist:** Engineers used to just build bridges and circuits. Now, we need to build artificial organs and software that reads DNA.
* **Biomimetics (Copy-pasting Nature):** Nature has been R&D-ing solutions for millions of years. Engineers just copy the homework.
    * *Example:* The **Shinkansen (Bullet Train)** was too loud (sonic boom). The engineer saw a **Kingfisher** dive into water without splashing. He redesigned the train nose like the bird's beak. Boom gone. Speed up 10%.
    * *Example:* **Owls** fly silently. We copied their feathers to make train parts quieter.

### The Cell: The Factory Floor
The cell is the smallest unit of life. Think of it like a factory.

**1. Prokaryotes (The Startup Open Office)**
* **Bacteria & Archaea.**
* **No Boss's Office:** No nucleus. The DNA (blueprints) just floats around in a messy pile called the Nucleoid.
* **Simple:** No fancy machines (membrane-bound organelles).
* **Tiny:** 0.1 - 0.5 microns.

**2. Eukaryotes (The Corporate HQ)**
* **Plants & Animals.**
* **The Boss's Office:** Has a **Nucleus** where DNA is safely locked away.
* **Departments:** Has fancy machines (Mitochondria, Golgi, etc.).
* **Big:** 10 - 100 microns.

### Key Machinery (Organelles)
* **Nucleus:** The CEO. Holds the Master Plan (DNA).
* **Mitochondria:** The Power Plant. Burns food to make **ATP** (energy cash).
* **Ribosomes:** The Workers. They read instructions and build Proteins.
* **Cell Membrane:** The Security Gate. Decides who comes in and who goes out.

### The Molecules (The Raw Materials)
* **Carbs:** Fuel. Glucose is the gas for the car.
* **Proteins:** The structural beams and the workers (Enzymes).
* **Lipids:** Fats. Used for walls (membranes) and long-term energy storage (the pantry).
* **Nucleic Acids (DNA/RNA):** The hard drive. Stores all the code.

# Unit 2: Stealing Ideas from Nature (Biomimetics)

Engineers look at animals and say, "I can build that, but with metal."

### 1. Construction & Composites
* **Nature's Concrete:** Bone and Wood are "composites" (mix of two things). Bone is Collagen (soft) + Minerals (hard).
* **Self-Healing Concrete:** Concrete cracks. We added bacteria that "wake up" when water hits a crack and poop out limestone to seal it. It's like a road that patches itself.
* **Termite Mounds (The AC Hack):** Termites build giant mounds that stay cool even in 40°C heat.
    * *How:* Passive ventilation chimneys. Hot air rises, sucks cool air in.
    * *The Steal:* The **Eastgate Centre in Zimbabwe** copied this. It uses 90% less energy for AC.

### 2. Fluid Dynamics (Water & Air)
* **Penguin Feet (Heat Exchangers):** Penguins stand on ice but don't freeze.
    * *The Trick:* Warm blood going down warms up the cold blood coming back up *before* it hits the body. It's a "Counter-Current Heat Exchanger."
    * *Engineering:* We use this in car radiators and chemical plants.
* **Submarines (Fake Fish):**
    * **Shape:** Tapered like a whale (Fusiform) to cut through water (reduce drag).
    * **Ballast Tanks:** Fish have a "Swim Bladder" (air balloon). Fill it to float, empty it to sink. Submarines do the exact same thing with water tanks.

### 3. Flight & Sonar
* **Planes:** Modeled on bird wings (airfoils) to generate lift (Bernoulli's principle).
* **Helicopters:** Basically a giant spinning insect wing or a maple seed falling.
* **Sonar:** Bats and Dolphins yell and listen to the echo to see in the dark. We put this on subs to find enemies and fish.

# Unit 3: Applied Tech (Saving the World)

### 1. Environment (Cleaning up the mess)
* **Climate Change:** We emitted too much CO2. Engineers are making bio-energy (fuel from plants) to fix it.
* **Waste:** Making plastic that actually rots (biodegradable) and microbes that eat trash.
* **Water:** Desalination (turning ocean water into drinking water) because we are running out of the fresh stuff.

### 2. Agriculture (Farming 2.0)
* **GMOs:** Hacking plant DNA to make them bug-proof and drought-proof.
* **Precision Farming:** Using drones and IoT sensors to water only the thirsty plants.
* **Bio-fertilizers:** Using good bacteria instead of harsh chemicals to help plants grow.

### 3. Medical Tech (Robo-Docs)
* **Biomedical Engineering:** MRI and CT scanners (looking inside without cutting).
* **Regenerative Medicine:** Using **Stem Cells** to grow new tissues. "Oh, you broke your liver? Here, grow a new one."
* **Biosensors:** Wearable tech (like glucose monitors) that tracks your health 24/7.
* **Prosthetics:** Robot arms that move like real muscles.
